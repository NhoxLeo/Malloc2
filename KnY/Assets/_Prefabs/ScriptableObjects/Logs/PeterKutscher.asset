  mainText: He was the first champion chosen by the great diviner. Thanks to his
    sharp wit, tremendous affinity for mana and his talent with the blade, he was
    considered one of the strongest heros the world had ever seen. Peter Kutscher
    was the first champion to be resurrected by the seed of the great diviner, and
    the last one to fall in the final battle against the dark ruler. Even though
    time has taken a toll on his human form, he's still a formidable opponent and
    capabale of enhancing his blade with mana.
