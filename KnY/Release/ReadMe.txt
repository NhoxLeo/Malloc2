Game is WIP!

If you encounter any bugs feel free to report them on the offical discort: Link tba.
I have fixed alot of bugs, but I don't really have the time to test them throughly, so chances are, they're still there... or that Github has reset one random class for some reason.

Most of the sprites and sounds are from Heart Machines Hyper Light Drifter. Please support the offical game
